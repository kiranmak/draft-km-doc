                  draft-kmak-intarea-energygrid-latest

Abstract

   This document describes the Operations and Control Network (OCN)
   scenario emerging from the modern or smart energy grid applications.
   These scenarios are derived to highlighting different behavior than
   the traditional networking leading to new requirements.  Traditional
   energy grids been a one way power distribution system, manged
   centrally.  However, new sources of power generation and provisioning
   for efficient use of energy, requires 2-way communication between
   different the consuming and consuming entities in the power grid
   networks.

1.  Introduction

   The traditional power grids are a single-soruce centralized power
   distribution network.  Power grid infrastructure involves a large
   power plant generator and that power to be distributed over large
   geographical areas using transmission lines to the utility customer.

   Essentially, the energy grid network is a large scale control system
   which is evolving with a goal of efficiently utilizing every unit of
   power generated.

   Although demand for energy continues to grow, it is difficult to
   setup and expand energy grids and transmission lines.  However,
   several cases arise when power stations will need to operate at full
   capacity or re-distribute energy load across different customer side
   substations.  Different types of surge in power consumption must be
   done dynamically with the help of automated controls and tools.

   Secondly, infrastructure continues to evolve to connect new sources
   of energy into the grid.  This also requires fine-grained control of
   switching power-sources based on pricing and on-demand parameters.

   Electrical grids and substations present with difficult operating
   conditions for plant operators due to hazards related to high
   voltages and current exposure (???) when faults occur.  This document
   provides role of communication systems to support automation and
   remote operation scenarios in the electric power grids to facilitate
   above mentioned challenges.

   This document provides a background of the power-grid architecture
   and discusses new scenarios requiring closer integration with the
   communication technologies.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   Protective Relays  are used in the power grids to detect defects and
      abnormal conditions in lines or apparatus to initiate appropriate
      control circuit action.

   Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs)  are microprocessor-based
      devices in the power systems that transmit and receive data or
      control external device such as microprocessor-based voltage
      regulators, protection relays, circuit breaker controllers, etc.
      that can communicate with other devices in the network.

   Distributed Energy Resources (DERs)  Distributed energy resources are
      small, modular, energy generation and storage technologies that
      provide electric capacity or energy closer to the customer site.
      Typically producing less than 10 megawatts (MW) of power.  DER
      systems may be either connected to the local electric power grid
      or be stand-alone applications Examples of DER technologies
      include wind turbines, photovoltaics (PV), fuel cells,
      microturbines, etc.  [FED-ENERGY-MGMT].  DER involves power
      electronic interfaces, communications and control devices for
      efficient operation of multiple components of power management.

   Merging Unit (MU)  is used to convert voltage and current readings
      from potential and current transformers, respectively, into
      digital data and publish them as Sampled measured values.

3.  Background

3.1.  High Level Overview

   The centralized power grid systems is a combination of devices and
   controllers operating at power generation, transmission, distribution
   substations and customer premises.

   The entire grid relies on traditional OT.  It requires SCADA or
   similar setup to monitor and control the voltage and power in each
   substation associated with the transmission, distribution and
   customer site substations.  Several of these functions are identical
   focusing on protection and distribution of electric current flowing
   through.

   Time synchronization [SYNC] is an important aspect of power grids
   since accurate timing is used to detect when and where malfunctions
   or disruption in power distribution occurred.  Time synchronized
   electric signals guarantee that current flowing through lines is in
   phase (ref and use case??)

   TODO: Add more on limitations.

3.2.  Communications in Power grid

   Communications in electric power systems are at two levels.  >1.
   Intra-substation communications: To facilitate connectivity and
   control functions through substation automation.  >2.  Inter-
   substation communications: To facilitate connectivity for
   synchronization, load redistribution and topology related functions.

3.2.1.  Subsystem Automation System (SAS)

3.2.2.  Protocols

   The communication requirements are documented in IEC 61850: Part 5
   standard (since this requires purchase of standard, the reference is
   not added to the document.  Instead [RT-MSGS] provides an indirect
   reference is used).

   Power grid systems use different types of messages listed in
   [RT-MSGS] below.

   *  IEC GOOSE protocol is an event-driven protocol designed to
      exchange messages between the IEDs over Ethernet.  It supports
      periodic and event based messages.  Event-based messages are used
      for reporting errors and are sent in bursts to compensate for any
      packet loss (since the protocol is publisher/subscriber based).
      The Figure 3 show all the protocol interfaces.

   *  Sampled Measured values (SV) protocol is also over Ethernet to
      connect the other side of IEDs interact over the process bus to
      collect sampled values (SV) from the devices.  The SV interfaces
      between the IEDs and MUs.  It is used to carry digital values of
      voltage and current and used for control and monitoring
      applications.  SMV messages are broadcast messages and an svID
      field is utilized to distinguish and classify them.

   *  MMS protocol is an application client/server protocol designed for
      interoperability between different device manufacturers.

   One of the problem with Ethernet based payloads on process and
   station bus is that the Ethernet is a broadcast medium and without
   appropriate address validation (or lack of it) can lead to substation
   susceptible to flooding attacks. see [SMV-ATTACKS] for more
   vulnerabilities in SMV and GOOSE protocols.

3.2.3.  Addresses

   All the protocols use Ethernet addresses for lower layer interface
   (MUs) and IP addresses for IEDs and above.

3.2.4.  Message types

   see table below.

3.3.  Other work

   Within the IETF technologies, some work on smart-grid is being done.
   [RFC6272] provides guidance for smart-grids to use existing IETF
   protocols.

   [I-D.6lo-plc] only relates to metering infrastructure and disucsses
   how IPv6 packets are transported over constrained PLC networks, such
   as ITU-T G.9903, IEEE 1901.1 and IEEE 1901.2.

4.  New Power grid Decentralization Scenarios

   This section describes a broad view of use cases requiring different
   perspective related to the communication aspects of power-grid
   systems.

   Smart grid innovation is leading to use of communication and digital
   technologies to perform different power distribution functions.  We
   cover 3 scenarios:

      1.  Connecting Distributed Energy Resources - decentralized energy
          distribution management of power and load distribution/
          balancing from different sources to improve overall
          performance of the grid.

      2.  Substation Automation Systems - Remote operation and and
          monitoring of SAS to reduce delays due to technician having to
          fix problems on-site. also to improve the safety of the
          technicians.

      3.  Advance metering infrastructure to address customer side peak
          demands and metering based on different sources of energy.

4.1.  Connecting Distributed Energy Resources

   Distributed energy resources (DERs) enable mechanisms to store
   locally generated energy for example from wind, solar, micro-turbines
   etc.  They are smaller, cleaner and cheaper sources of energy as
   compared to bulk power generation.

   The DER mechanisms require precise control and monitoring procedures.

   *  DER systems improve reliability when incidence such as service
      interruption happens from main power source.

   *  if DER energy source is renewable it reduces cost of decreasing
      consumption from main supplier.

4.1.1.  Requirements and Challenges

   The communication between DER to end-units (inverters, batteries) is
   of type operations and control functions. i.e. a controlling entity
   will control DER in local geographies and end-units on customer
   premises.  It executes commands that will cause switching of power-
   source in either direction and regularly read sensors.

   Connecting different types of DERs to the grids leads to a large-
   scale single deplyoment.  Some of the challenges arising due to this
   are:

   *  A partial knowledge about any energy resource or requirement may
      result in the instability of the voltage profile.

   *  There is a need to redesign systems for 2 way communications in
      which different DERs will let smrt-grid operator know about
      available power and its demand requirement

4.2.  Substation Automation System

   The Substation automation system is responsible for control,
   monitoring and safety of transmission equipment in substations.  It
   uses well-known industry control technologies like SCADA system and
   process bus to carry out sampled measurements of various operational
   parameters such as voltage, current, etc.  It also sends command to
   several types of switchgear equipment such as transformers, voltage
   equipment, and circuit breakers over communication network.

   Substation automation system uses process buses to control and
   monitor switchgear equipment to read voltage and frequency values.

   The core functions of substations are:

      -  Protection of switch gear against transmitted frequency,
         voltage fluctuations and changes in environment.  This requires
         synchronizing sampled measurements from different points in the
         substation.

      -  Interlocking

      -  Automatic switching sequences

   The messages mentioned above are critical to the operations of the
   grid.  They require guarantee of in-time and ordered deliveries and
   high reliability.

4.2.1.  Message latency

   Messages for substation communication have been identified based on
   their criticality in IEC 61850.  The messages types are mapped
   according to their communication performance requirements shown in
   Table 1 along with their types.  The network is hybrid, it transmits
   critical and real-time messsages directly over the link layer.  For
   example, type1, 1A are time-critical and are carried over the
   Ethernet directly.  The 'type 2' are medium speed message (type 2)
   and several others are non-critical (source: [RT-MSGS]).

5.  Requirements

   In the current design, potential limitations that prevent complete
   automation of substations maybe observed as:

      -  The network needs to maintain several states from a variety of
         protocols and perform conversion from SVM to GOOSE to MMS.
         There are opportunities to simplify and converge MMS and GOOSE
         protocols into single network layer interface.

      -  Moreover, SVM is design to broadcast alarm messages repeatedly
         (or as a burst) to compensate for the potential packet loss.  A
         robust and reliable design of network layer protocol can
         eliminate flooding.

      -  Remote operations in substations are pivotal to workers' safety
         especially in case of accidents and inclement weather
         conditions.  In order to make remote operations feasible, above
         mentioned messages need support over a wide-area networks.

   To summarize, automation requires leveraging IT-grade software and
   services.  Then allowing those services to directly control and
   monitor the substations.

5.1.  Decentralization in Energy Grids

   TODO??

5.2.  Smart Energy Grids

   Support for smart-grids is necessary to interconnect different
   sources of energy, have a system level view of where peak-demand or
   consumption is changing, where faults are occurring and how energy
   can be used efficiently overall.

   This requires finer granularity of monitoring, control, and data
   acquisition of the electricity network which will extend down to the
   distribution pole-top transformer and perhaps even to individual
   customers, either through the substation communication network, by
   means of a separate feeder communication network (chapter 22,
   [POWER-SUBS]).

5.2.1.  Key Performance Parameters

   - Metering - Wide area monitoring (using synchrophasors) -- use of
   time synchronization for phase matching in distribution network. -
   Power conditioning - Electricity storage
